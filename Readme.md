Creating a README file is an essential part of documenting your project. It provides users and developers with important information about your application, including how to install, use, and contribute to it. Below is a sample README file for your House Booking System project.

## Sample README File

- Simple command-line interface for user interaction.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

### Step 3: Set Up MySQL Database

1. Create a new database called `HosueRental` (or your preferred name).
